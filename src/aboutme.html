				<!-- My story: this is little long winded, need to refine -->
				<h2>How I got into coding:</h2>
				<div class="aboutmecontainer"><img src="images/pc/aboutme/aboutme01.jpg" alt=""></div><p>I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Colorado State University in 2007. After graduation, I began teaching high school math and soon earned my Master’s degree so I could move my career path toward school administration. As a teacher, I took on additional responsibilities (data specialist, instructional coach, etc.) to gain vital leadership experience. I made the jump from teaching to school administration in 2014, when I became the Dean of Students at Bennett School District 29J. Soon after, I was named Principal of Bennett Middle School.<br><br>
				Over the last few years, I have discovered an intense passion for technology, and specifically programming. I started off building computers and teaching myself some computer hardware and software basics in my free time. I began teaching myself to program in C#, creating text adventure games and simple programs. As my hobby grew, I decided to enroll in Computer Science courses at Metropolitan State University. I learned the fundamentals of object oriented programming and I’ve since learned how to write programs in Python, Java, Java Script, HTML5, CSS, SQL, mySQL, and others. I am truly curious about all forms of coding. I love designing websites or solving complex problems. My creative and logical itches are scratched by programming, and I feel truly happy when I am tackling a new project.<br><br>
				When my passion for technology outweighed my desire to stay in education, I made the decision to change my career and my life. I found an opportunity to work a Help Desk position in my district. While working at the Help Desk, I gained experience in active directory, troubleshooting networks issues, managing the district website, and working on multiple education platforms for student and teacher data. It was a great opportunity to work on hard and soft skills and to understand the technology needs for a relatively large organization, all while affording me more flexibility to take courses at Metro.<br><br>
				In January 2018, I began working as the Online Education Specialist at PSA Security Networks – my first job outside of the school environment. This job has provided me the opportunity to dive into HTML and manage/create content for PSAEducation.com. I am still learning many new skills, and will continue to explore my newfound passion. Navigating such a drastic career change wasn’t easy, but I am excited to pursue new opportunities and tackle new challenges as I dive headfirst into the world of tech.<br><br>
				To see more of my projects and skills, please visit my portfolio page at <a href="http://zstall.com">zstall.com</a>. I will update this website as I create new content.<br><br>
				If you see an opportunity for me to help you or your company, please reach out. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning. My email is: <a href="mailto:zstall4@gmail.com">zstall4@gmail.com</a></p>
