				<h2>How I got into coding:</h2>
				<div class="aboutmecontainer"><img src="images/pc/aboutme/aboutme01.jpg" alt=""></div><p>My professional journey. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. One day, I found myself at Colorado State University desperately needing to find some direction. I started off as an aspiring graphic design major. However, I was not a fan of the intro art classes and decided to explore other options. I investigated philosophy as I enjoyed my entry level course, but this major had no clear path to a career. I over compensated and dove into a semester of engineering loading up on physics and calculus. I enjoyed the challenge but feared that this path would lead to a life of long hours and no work life balance. Which is okay, if you love what you do.<br><br>
				I finally decided to at least stick with math. I liked the idea of challenging myself in my undergrad. No matter what happened career wise, I would always know that I challenged myself in my studies at college. Also, with something as technical as mathematics, I figured I would land on my feet. At the end of my college career (thanks to all the math course work), I did a lot of tutoring for extra cash, and that is when the idea of becoming a teacher was born. I would have a fulfilling career, where I could feel like a made a difference. I could share my passion for mathematics, and education would afford me a schedule that would allow me to have a life outside of work.<br><br>
				I worked in education for 10 years. I earned a master’s degree and became an administrator after teaching high school math for 7 of the ten years. I ran a small middle school in eastern Colorado. I will always look back at my time in education as some of the most rewarding. Somewhere along the way, I finally discovered what I want to do with my life, and that is how I have found myself here. I have found a intense passion for technology, and specifically programming. I started off building computers and teaching myself some computer hardware and software basics. From setting up work stations, to building custom high-powered gaming pc’s. 
				I started out teaching myself to program in C#. I created text adventure games, and simple programs that would store names and birthdates. As my hobby grew I decided to take some classes at Metropolitan State University in down town Denver. I learned the fundamentals of object oriented programming and began to build my foundation of best practice for someone who wants to learn and be a coder/developer.<br><br> 
				I’ve since learned how to write programs in Python, Java, Java Script, HTML5, CSS, SQL, mySQL, and others. I am truly curious about all forms of coding. I love designing websites or solving difficult and complex problems. My creative and logical itches are scratched by programming, and I feel truly happy when I am tackling a new project that is stretching my skills!
				When my passion for technology outweighed my desire to stay in education, I found an opportunity to work a help desk position in a school district. I had the opportunity to work with active directory, image machines for new users, trouble shoot networks issues, manage the district website, and work on several education platforms for student and teacher data. It was a great job and opportunity to work on hard and soft skills and technology needs for a relatively large organization. I then found an opportunity at PSA Security Networks as their online education specialist. This provided me the opportunity to dive into HTML and manage/create content for PSAEducaiton.com. I am still learning many new skills, and will continue to explore my new found passion. To see more of my projects and skills, please visit my portfolio page at <a href="http://www.ztall.com">zstall.com</a>. I will update this website as I create new content.<br><br>
				If you see an opportunity for me to help you or your company, please reach out. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning. My email is: <a href="mailto:zstall4@gmail.com">zstall4@gmail.com</a></p>
